# == Define: openssl::self_signed_certificate
#
# Generates an RSA keypair and a self-signed X.509 certificate using OpenSSL.
#
# The keypair file is created in /etc/ssl/private, and the certificate is
# created in /etc/ssl, which are the standard directories on
# Debian/Ubuntu.  The files are named after the resource:
# /etc/ssl/private/<name>.key and /etc/ssl/<name>.pem.  Certificate files are
# owned by root:root, and have permissions 0644.
#
# The generated keypair and certificate files are not protected: if any
# parameter is changed, they are re-generated.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*key*]
#   The path to key file
#
# [*key_bits*]
#   The number of bits of the RSA public key to generate.  If not specified,
#   defaults to 1024.
#
# [*key_owner*]
#   The user to whom the keypair file should belong.  Argument can be a user
# name or a user ID.  If not specified, defaults to "root".
#
# [*key_group*]
#   The group to whom the keypair file should belong.  Argument can be a group
#   name or a group ID.  If not specified, defaults to "root".
#
# [*key_mode*]
#   The desired permissions mode for the keypair file, in symbolic or numeric
#   notation.  If not specified, defaults to "0600".
#
# [*cert*]
#   The path to certificate file
#
# [*cert_days*]
#   The validity period of the X.509 certificate, in days.  If not specified,
#   defaults to 365.
#
# [*cert_country*]
#   The country code part of the X.509 certificate's distinguished name.
#   Optional.
#
# [*cert_state*]
#   The state / province part of the X.509 certificate's distinguished name.
#   Optional.
#
# [*cert_locality*]
#   The locality part of the X.509 certificate's distinguished name. Optional.
#
# [*cert_organization*]
#   The organization part of the X.509 certificate's distinguished name.
#   Optional.
#
# [*cert_common_names*]
#   The list of common names in the X.509 certificate's distinguished name.
#   Optional.
#
# [*cert_email_address*]
#   The X.509 certificate's contact email address.  Optional.
#
